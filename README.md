# About

Simple web GUI for that spits out FFmpeg commands for generating streaming ladder from video file. 

**Note:**
* This is a re-upload and the project is fairly old. I might make some minimal tweaks to it but right now I'm putting it here mostly for archival purposes.
* The GUI is not meant to cover every feature in FFmpeg, just a select few I needed at the time that I made this tool.
